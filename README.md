Code and more for Raspberry Pi Pico
If you enjoy doing experiments with Raspberry Pi and Pi Pico, then the content here may be useful for you. Please always note the disclaimer. So I am not liable if you implement my suggestions and projects, use my code or build experiments. Something could go wrong or cause damage for a variety of reasons. So you do all of this at your own risk. Nevertheless, I am of course trying to avoid any risk.

Of course you can use my code, copy it, change it and so on. Good luck with it and great projects with your Raspberry Pi or Raspberry Pi Pico. You can find more information about the hardware on the Raspberry Pi Foundation UK website.

You can find a description and pictures of the project in a post on my blog:
